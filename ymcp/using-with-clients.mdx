## Integrating yMCP

Connecting your AI development environment or agent framework to yMCP involves configuring it with your yMCP Endpoint URL and API Key. Hereâ€™s how to do it for common platforms:

### Cursor

1.  Open Cursor's settings/preferences.
2.  Navigate to the section for configuring MCP (Model Context Protocol) or Tools.
3.  Enter the **yMCP Endpoint URL** you obtained from the Lomen dashboard.
4.  In the authentication or API key field, enter your unique **yMCP API Key**.
5.  Save the configuration. Cursor should now be able to access Lomen's hosted Web3 servers via yMCP.

### Claude Desktop (Conceptual)

_Note: Specific steps depend on the Claude Desktop version and its MCP support._

1.  Look for settings related to "Tools," "Integrations," or "Model Context Protocol."
2.  Input the **yMCP Endpoint URL**.
3.  Provide your **yMCP API Key** when prompted for authentication (likely using a Bearer token or custom header format `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_YMCP_API_KEY`).
4.  Consult the specific Claude Desktop documentation for exact configuration details.

### Custom Applications / Agents

When making requests from your own code:

1.  Target the **yMCP Endpoint URL** for your MCP requests.
2.  Include your **yMCP API Key** in the request headers, typically as an `Authorization` Bearer token:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_YMCP_API_KEY
    ```
3.  Ensure your application follows the Model Context Protocol specification for structuring requests and handling responses.

Refer to the documentation of your specific client or framework for precise instructions on configuring custom MCP endpoints and authentication headers.
