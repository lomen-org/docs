## Securing Your yMCP Access

Your yMCP API key provides access to Lomen's hosted Web3 MCP servers under your account. It's crucial to keep this key secure, just like any other sensitive credential.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Secret:** Never share your API key publicly or with unauthorized individuals.
- **Do Not Embed in Code:** Avoid hardcoding your API key directly in your application source code. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems instead.
- **Avoid Committing to Version Control:** Ensure your API key is never committed to Git repositories or other version control systems (use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms).
- **Limit Exposure:** Only provide the key to trusted applications and services that require it.
- **Regenerate if Compromised:** If you suspect your API key has been exposed or compromised, regenerate it immediately via the Lomen platform dashboard (link to be provided) and update your applications accordingly.

## Managing Your Key

You can typically manage your yMCP API key (e.g., view usage if available, regenerate, delete) through your account settings on the Lomen platform dashboard. Refer to the specific dashboard sections for key management options.
