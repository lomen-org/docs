## Accessing yMCP

To begin using Lomen's hosted Web3 MCP servers, you need your unique yMCP API key and the service endpoint URL.

## Step 1: Obtain Your API Key

1.  **Sign Up/Login:** Access the Lomen platform dashboard (link to be provided).
2.  **Navigate to yMCP:** Find the yMCP section within your account settings or services.
3.  **Generate Key:** Follow the prompts to generate your unique yMCP API key. **Important:** Copy this key immediately and store it securely. You may not be able to see it again after generation.

## Step 2: Note the Endpoint URL

Your yMCP service endpoint URL will be provided alongside your API key, typically in the Lomen dashboard. This single URL is used for all interactions with the Lomen-hosted Web3 servers via your key.

It will generally look something like this (example only):
`https://ymcp.ai/v1/mcp`

## Next Steps

With your API key and endpoint URL, you are ready to configure your AI client or application. Proceed to the "Using with Clients" guide for integration instructions.
