**What is yMCP again?**
yMCP is Lomen's managed service providing unified access to Lomen-hosted, Web3-specific MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers via a single API key. It simplifies connecting AI applications to Web3 tools and protocols.

**How is yMCP different from running my own MCP server?**
With yMCP, Lomen hosts and manages the Web3-specific MCP servers. You don't need to set up or maintain the server infrastructure yourself. You simply use the provided yMCP API key for access.

**What specific Web3 tools/protocols can I access via yMCP?**
yMCP provides access to a curated set of Web3-focused MCP servers hosted by Lomen. Please refer to the Lomen platform dashboard or specific announcements for the current list of supported Web3 integrations.

**Do I need separate API keys for each Web3 tool I want my AI to use?**
No. The core benefit of yMCP is providing a _single_ API key that grants access to _all_ the Lomen-hosted Web3 MCP servers available through the service.

**Is using yMCP secure?**
Yes. Access is controlled via your unique API key. Follow best practices for API key management to keep your access secure. Refer to the `API Key Management` page for details.

**What AI clients or platforms can use yMCP?**
Any client or platform that supports configuring a custom MCP endpoint and API key authentication (typically via Bearer token) can potentially use yMCP. See the `Using with Clients` page for examples like Cursor and Claude Desktop.
