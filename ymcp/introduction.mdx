## What is yMCP?

yMCP (Your Model Context Protocol) is Lomen's managed service designed to dramatically simplify how your AI applications and agents interact with the Web3 ecosystem.

It provides unified access to a suite of **Lomen-hosted, Web3-specific MCP servers**. Instead of juggling multiple connections and API keys for various blockchain protocols or services, yMCP offers a single, secure endpoint and **one API key** to access them all.

## The Power of MCP for Web3

Built upon the principles of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), yMCP allows your AI to securely discover and interact with available Web3 tools and data sources. Think of MCP as a standardized way for AI to "talk" to external services. yMCP leverages this standard specifically for Web3 interactions, managed entirely by Lomen.

## Why yMCP?

- **Simplified Access:** Connect to multiple Web3 protocols and services through one consistent interface and API key.
- **Reduced Overhead:** No need to self-host MCP servers or manage individual API keys for supported Web3 tools â€“ Lomen handles the infrastructure.
- **Web3 Focused:** Access MCP servers specifically designed and maintained by Lomen for interacting with blockchain networks and protocols.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easily connect your favorite AI development platforms or custom agents to the power of Web3.

Get started with yMCP to streamline your AI's connection to the decentralized world.
