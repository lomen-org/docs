To get the most accurate and helpful responses from Lomen Chat, consider these tips:

## Be Specific with Queries

- **Provide Context:** When asking about specific assets or addresses, include token symbols (e.g., `$WIF`), contract addresses, or ENS/SNS names if possible. Mention the chain if it might be ambiguous (e.g., "USDC balance on Polygon").
- **Clear Questions:** Ask direct questions. Instead of "Tell me about this wallet," try "What tokens does `wallet-address.eth` hold on Ethereum?" or "Show me the recent transaction history for `wallet-address.sol`."

## Clarity for Actions

- **State Intent Clearly:** For actions like sending or swapping, clearly state the amount, the token, and the destination (address or pool). Example: "Send 10 USDC on Base to `0x...`" or "Swap 0.5 ETH for USDC on Arbitrum."
- **Double-Check Confirmations:** Lomen Chat will present transaction details for your review before execution. _Always_ carefully verify the amounts, addresses, and expected outcomes before signing any transaction in your wallet.

## Refining Analysis

- **Start Broad, Then Narrow:** For complex analysis (like PnL over a custom period), start with a general request (e.g., "Show my wallet PnL") and then ask follow-up questions to refine the timeframe or specific assets.

## Use Natural Language

- **Talk Conversationally:** You don't need special syntax. Phrase your requests as you would normally speak or type.

By following these practices, you can ensure Lomen Chat understands your requests accurately and helps you navigate the blockchain world efficiently and safely.
