**What is Lomen Chat?**
Lomen Chat is a conversational AI assistant, like "Perplexity for Blockchains," that allows you to query, analyze, monitor, and perform actions on major Solana and EVM blockchains using natural language.

**What can Lomen Chat do?**
It can answer questions about blockchain data (wallets, tokens, NFTs, contracts), provide analytical insights (PnL, portfolio value, token analysis), perform on-chain actions (send tokens, swaps - with your confirmation), and set up monitoring tasks (alerts, reminders).

**Do I need to connect a wallet to use Lomen Chat?**
You can ask general blockchain questions without connecting a wallet. However, to perform on-chain actions or get personalized analytics (like your own wallet's PnL), you will need to connect your wallet.

**What blockchains does it support?**
Lomen Chat supports major Solana and EVM-compatible chains. Please see the `Supported Chains` page for a more detailed list.

**Is Lomen Chat free?**
Information about Lomen Chat's pricing and usage tiers will be made available. There may be free features alongside premium capabilities. (Note: Update this based on actual pricing model).

**How is this different from a block explorer like Etherscan or Solscan?**
Block explorers show raw, structured data. Lomen Chat provides a conversational interface, allows for complex natural language queries, performs analysis and calculations (like PnL), sets up monitoring, and can initiate on-chain actions based on your instructions.

**How can I ask effective questions or give clear instructions?**
Being specific, providing context (like addresses or chain names), and clearly stating your intent helps Lomen Chat understand you best. Refer to the `Best Practices` page for more tips.
