## Multi-Chain Capabilities

Lomen Chat is designed to operate across multiple blockchain ecosystems, allowing you to query, analyze, and interact without constantly switching tools.

We currently support major chains within the following ecosystems:

### Solana

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) Chains

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Polygon PoS
- Base
- Optimism
- Arbitrum One
- _(More EVM chains may be supported - list is indicative)_

## Expanding Coverage

We are continuously working to expand Lomen Chat's capabilities to include more chains and protocols. Check back here for updates on newly supported networks. If you have a specific chain you'd like to see supported, let us know through our community channels!
