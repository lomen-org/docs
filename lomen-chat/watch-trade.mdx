# Watch Trade with Lomen

Watch trade allows you to monitor and receive notifications when specific wallet addresses perform transactions. This feature is perfect for tracking successful traders or whale wallets and staying informed about their market moves.

## How to Set Up Watch Trade

### 1. Create a Group

First, create a group of addresses you want to track:

- **Using the UI**: Navigate to the Groups section and select "Create New Group"
- **Using a Prompt**: Type `create group millionaires` (replace "millionaires" with your desired group name)

### 2. Add Addresses to Your Group

Add wallet addresses to monitor:

- **Using the UI**: Select your group and click "Add Address"
- **Using a Prompt**: Type `add 0x123...abc to millionaires` (replace with actual addresses)

### 3. Configure Watch Trade Settings

Set up notifications for specific transaction types:

- **Transfer**: Get notified when addresses transfer tokens
- **Buy**: Get notified when addresses purchase tokens
- **Sell**: Get notified when addresses sell tokens

### 4. Set Up Notifications

Use prompts to create notification rules with conditions:

```
setup watchtrade If anyone from millionaires transfer > $10, notify me
```

```
setup watchtrade If anyone from millionaires sell < $10, notify me
```
