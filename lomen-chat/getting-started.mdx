## Accessing Lomen Chat

Getting started with Lomen Chat is simple:

1.  **Navigate:** Open your web browser and go to [**chat.lomen.org**](https://chat.lomen.org).
2.  **Login/Sign Up:** Access the service using your Lomen account (or sign up if you're new).

## Connecting Your Wallet (Recommended)

While you can ask general blockchain questions without connecting a wallet, you'll need to connect one to:

- Perform on-chain actions (like sending tokens or swapping).
- Get personalized analytics (like your wallet's PnL or portfolio).

**To connect your wallet:**

- Look for a "Connect Wallet" button within the Lomen Chat interface.
- Select your preferred wallet provider (e.g., Phantom, MetaMask).
- Approve the connection request in your wallet extension or app.

_Lomen Chat only requests permissions necessary for querying balances and initiating transactions, which you will always need to sign and approve._

## Your First Interaction

Try asking a simple question:

> "What is the current price of Solana?"

Or, if your wallet is connected, try initiating an action (you'll be asked to confirm before sending):

> "Prepare a transaction to send 0.1 SOL to `recipient-address.sol`"
