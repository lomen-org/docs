Lomen Hub is designed to make accessing complex blockchain data simple and intuitive, even for developers without extensive Web3 experience.

## Discovering Datasets

The Lomen Hub platform includes a **Decentralized Data Marketplace** where you can browse, search, and discover available datasets. You can explore datasets based on:

- Category (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Market Data)
- Blockchain Network
- Data Provider Reputation
- Specific use case requirements

We provide tools like sample datasets and pre-built notebooks to help you evaluate data quality and relevance before full integration.

## Seamless Integration

Once you find the dataset you need, Lomen Hub offers streamlined ways to integrate it into your applications, AI models, or agent workflows:

- **APIs:** Access data programmatically using standard interfaces like RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints. Query data directly in formats like JSON, CSV, or use SQL-like query capabilities.
- **SDKs:** Utilize our multi-language Software Development Kits (SDKs) – including Python, JavaScript, and Rust – for easier integration with minimal boilerplate code. SDKs support features like batch queries and data caching.
- **Real-time Streams:** Connect via WebSocket endpoints for applications requiring continuous, live data updates (e.g., trading bots, real-time monitoring).
- **Chat Interfaces:** Interact with and query datasets conversationally through integrations with AI chat platforms.

Our goal is to allow developers and AI agents to consume blockchain data as easily as any other data source, abstracting away the underlying complexities of node infrastructure and data processing.
