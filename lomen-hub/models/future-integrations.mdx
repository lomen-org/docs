## Evolving the Ecosystem

Lomen Hub's role begins with providing the essential data layer, but our vision extends towards a more integrated ecosystem for AI development on the blockchain.

Based on insights from the Lomen Hub light paper, future expansions ("Expanding the Frontier") aim to include:

- **Integrated Models:** Exploring ways to potentially incorporate pre-trained or specialized AI models directly into the Lomen Hub marketplace, making them easily accessible alongside the datasets they utilize.
- **Agent Toolkits:** Developing open frameworks and tools designed to simplify the process of connecting AI agents (powered by various models) to blockchain protocols and enabling them to perform actions on-chain securely and effectively.

These future integrations aim to create a comprehensive environment where developers can not only access data but also potentially find models and tools to accelerate the creation and deployment of powerful autonomous agents and AI-driven applications within the Web3 space. Stay tuned to our roadmap for updates on these developments.
