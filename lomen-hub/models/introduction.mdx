## Lomen Hub: The Data Foundation for AI Models

Lomen Hub's core mission is to provide the essential data infrastructure needed to power the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) models operating within the blockchain space.

While the Hub's primary offering is a **universal data layer** and a marketplace for high-quality datasets, its ultimate goal is to enable sophisticated AI models and autonomous agents to thrive.

Think of Lomen Hub as the foundational layer providing the fuel (data) required for the engines (AI models) that will drive innovation in the agent-first world of Web3. We provide the structured, verified, real-time information that models need to understand and interact with complex blockchain ecosystems effectively.
