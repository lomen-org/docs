## What is Lomen Hub?

Lomen Hub provides developers with blockchain focused models and datasets to build and train agents. Lomen's mission is to accelerate AI development by making the building blocks for AI in web3 universally accessible and usable. We envision a world where the creation and deployment of next-generation autonomous agents is simpler, unlocking innovation across web3.

## Blockchain Focused Models

These are models that are trained on blockchain datasets. Why is this important? Simply put, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT don't have a deep semantic understanding of what blockchains are and what use cases there might be. Hence, it treats the problem differently. Imagine having models trained on Greek philosophy being asked to predict the price of a token, it doesn't use 99% of it's training and results in terrible hallucinations. This is why we need blockchain focused models that make it easy to do blockchain tasks -- that too in a computationally efficient way.

## Blockchain Datasets

Blockchain datasets referred to processed, structured, indexed and labelled data that can be used for training or inference. Blockchain data requires a number of expensive processing steps before it's usable. It's typically also fragmented and inconsistent across various chains and applications, making it hard to access inefficiently.

Another issue is that blockchain data in it's raw form is not optimized for AI training and real-time decision making required by agents.

## Lomen Hub's Vision

Lomen Hub seeks to create foundational infrastructure for an **agent-first world**. We transform raw, fragmented blockchain data into actionable, AI-friendly resources. Our platform enables seamless interaction between AI agents and decentralized applications by providing access to models and robust, real-time datasets, empowering developers to create innovative applications without needing deep blockchain expertise beforehand.
