## AI-Powered Strategy Discovery

Lomen's AI continuously analyzes the DeFi landscape to discover, evaluate, and recommend optimal strategies for your baskets. Our AI doesn't just find opportunities — it understands context, assesses risk, and surfaces strategies that align with your goals.

## What the AI Analyzes

Our discovery engine monitors and evaluates:

## The Discovery Process

## Benefits of AI Discovery

### Continuous Monitoring

Unlike manual research, our AI never sleeps. It continuously scans protocols, tracks changes in yields, and identifies new opportunities as they emerge.

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

The AI considers multiple factors simultaneously:

- **Yield potential**: Expected returns across different strategies
- **Risk profile**: Smart contract risk, liquidity risk, market risk
- **Efficiency**: Gas costs, slippage, execution complexity
- **Compatibility**: How strategies work together in a basket

### Personalized Recommendations

The AI tailors suggestions based on:

- Your current portfolio composition
- Your risk tolerance
- Your investment goals
- Historical performance preferences

## How It Helps You

**Save Time**: No need to manually research protocols, compare yields, or analyze risks. The AI does the heavy lifting.

**Better Decisions**: Get data-driven recommendations backed by comprehensive analysis, not just gut feelings.

**Stay Updated**: As market conditions change, the AI adapts and surfaces new opportunities automatically.

**Reduce Risk**: The AI considers risk factors you might miss, helping you make more informed decisions.

## Transparency and Control

While the AI handles discovery and analysis, you always maintain control:

- **See the reasoning**: Understand why strategies are recommended
- **Review details**: Examine protocol performance, yields, and risks
- **Make the call**: You decide which strategies to execute
- **Your assets**: Everything stays in your wallet — the AI never has custody

## What the AI Doesn't Do

To protect our intellectual property and maintain security:

- We don't reveal the specific algorithms or models used
- We don't expose the exact ranking or scoring mechanisms
- We focus on explaining **what** the AI does and **why** it helps you, not **how** it works internally

The AI is your intelligent assistant for navigating DeFi — providing insights, surfacing opportunities, and helping you make better decisions, all while you maintain complete control over your assets.
