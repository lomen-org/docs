## What are Baskets?

Baskets are Lomen's core innovation — programmable, multi-asset containers that package together curated strategies, assets, and protocols into a single, manageable investment vehicle. Think of a basket as a transparent, customizable portfolio that executes complex DeFi strategies with just one click.

## How Baskets Work

Baskets combine multiple assets and protocols into a unified strategy. Each basket is:

- **Transparent**: You can see exactly what's inside — which assets, which protocols, and how they work together
- **Programmable**: Baskets execute multi-step strategies automatically, handling complex operations across different protocols
- **Self-custodial**: Your assets stay in your wallet. You maintain full control and can exit anytime
- **Dynamic**: Baskets can be rebalanced automatically or manually to maintain optimal allocations

## What Goes Inside a Basket?

A basket can contain:

## Basket Structure

Each basket is designed around a specific investment theme or strategy. For example, a "Yield Optimizer" basket might combine high-yield opportunities across lending protocols, while a "Liquidity Provider" basket could manage LP positions across multiple DEXs.

## Why Baskets Matter

Baskets solve the complexity problem in DeFi. Instead of:

- Managing multiple wallets and platforms
- Manually executing multi-step strategies
- Tracking positions across different protocols
- Constantly rebalancing allocations

You get:

- **One-click execution** of complex strategies
- **Unified view** of all your positions
- **Automated management** of your investments
- **Full transparency** into what's happening

## Getting Started with Baskets

1. Browse available baskets in the Lomen App
2. Review what's inside each basket — assets, protocols, and strategies
3. Select a basket that aligns with your investment goals
4. Execute with one click — your assets stay in your wallet

Baskets make sophisticated DeFi strategies accessible to everyone, while maintaining the security and control of self-custody.
