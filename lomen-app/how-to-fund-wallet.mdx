## Funding your wallet

Lomen offers multiple convenient ways to add funds to your wallet. You can choose the method that best suits your needs.

### 1. Pay with Card

You can instantly purchase cryptocurrency using your debit or credit card. We support popular payment methods like Google Pay for a seamless transaction experience. This is the easiest way to get started if you don't own any cryptocurrency yet. All transactions are securely processed by Privy.

### 2. Transfer from an Exchange

If you already have cryptocurrency on a centralized exchange like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, you can transfer it to your Lomen wallet.

1.  Select "Transfer from an exchange" in the Lomen app.
2.  Copy your Lomen wallet address.
3.  Go to your exchange account and initiate a withdrawal.
4.  Paste your Lomen wallet address as the destination for the withdrawal.
5.  Confirm the transaction on the exchange.

### 3. Transfer from another Wallet

You can also transfer funds from another self-custodial wallet, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Ledger.

1.  Select "Transfer from wallet" in the Lomen app.
2.  Copy your Lomen wallet address.
3.  Open your other wallet and start a new transfer.
4.  Paste your Lomen wallet address in the recipient field.
5.  Set the amount and confirm the transaction.

### 4. Receive Funds

This option allows you to receive cryptocurrency from someone else. The app will display your unique wallet address and a corresponding QR code. You can share this with the sender, and they can use it to send funds directly to your wallet.
